// Xcode target configuration settings for the Max 7 SDK (max-sdk)

// Changes to the settings in this file will be applied to all the projects that depend on these configs
// To change settings for only one of the externals, override the settings using

// The following section sets the Mac SDK version to be used.
// For most projects this has little to no impact because there are no direct dependencies on OS function calls.
// In those projects with OS function calls, it should be okay to use the most recent SDK version because the
// MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET will disable functionality that is unavailable in the older target OS.
// For this reason, the SDKROOT variable is commented out, telling Xcode to use the default (which is the most recent SDK).
